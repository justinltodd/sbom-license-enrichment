# GITHUB_TOKEN is used by the enrichment script to increase GitHub API rate limits
# and retrieve license information for Go modules hosted on GitHub.
#
# This variable is OPTIONAL for small SBOMs but RECOMMENDED for large ones or CI/CD pipelines.
#
# For better security, you can export GITHUB_TOKEN as a system environment variable instead of using this file:
#   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtokenhere
#
# If using this file, rename it to `.env` and replace the placeholder value below.

GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtokenhere
